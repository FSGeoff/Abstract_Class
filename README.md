## Abstract Classes

### Employees example: Abstract classes and pure virtual functions.

The classes below describe an abstract class named EmployeePerson and two derived classes, 
EmployeeManager and EmployeeStaff, both of which are derived from the EmployeePerson class. 
The main program creates objects of type EmployeeManager and EmployeeStaff and prints them.
